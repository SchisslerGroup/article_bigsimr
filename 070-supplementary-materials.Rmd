# Supplementary Materials {.unnumbered #misc}


We provide an open-source implementation of our methodology as the `Bigsimr.jl` Julia package, hosted on github at https://github.com/SchisslerGroup/Bigsimr.jl. Additionally we provide R and Python interfaces to `Bigsimr`, respectively on https://github.com/SchisslerGroup/r-bigsimr and https://github.com/SchisslerGroup/python-bigsimr. A stable release of the R package `bigsimr` is available on CRAN. `Bigsimr.jl` is an ongoing project, and feature requests or issues can be submitted to https://github.com/adknudson/Bigsimr.jl/issues.
